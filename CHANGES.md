3.0.0 (unreleased)
------------------
- This release addresses some known encoding-related issues:
  - The internal path format are now native strings (i.e. unicode on Python 3 
    or UTF-8 bytes on Python 2)

    **TODO:** pass `--remote-encoding` to override this.
  - #30: Fallback to CP-1252 encoding when FTP server returns non-UTF-8
  - Local filesystem targets now consider the OS encoding.
  - Modified format of `.pyftpsync-meta.json`: File names are now stored as UTF-8
    (was the unmodified binary format of the target platform before).
  - See also the 'encoding' section in the 
    [spec](https://github.com/mar10/pyftpsync/blob/master/docs/sphinx/pyftpsync-spec.pdf).
