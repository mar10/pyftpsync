Features
========

  * This is a command line tool...
  * ... and a library for use in custom Python projects.
  * Recursive synchronisation of folders on file system and/or FTP targets.
  * Upload, download, and bi-directional synchronization mode.
  * Configurable conflict resolution strategies.
  * Unlike naive implementations, pyftpsync maintains additional meta data to
    detect conflicts and decide whether to replicate a missing file as deletion
    or addition.
  * Unlike more complex implementations, pyftpsync does not require a database
    or a service running on the targets.
  * Optional FTPS (TLS) support.
  * Architecture is open to add other target types.

**The command line tool adds:**

  * Runs on Linux, OS X, and Windows.
  * Remember passwords in system keyring.
  * Interactive conflict resolution mode.
  * Dry-run mode.


.. note:: Known Limitations

  * The FTP server must support the `MLSD command <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3659>`_.
  * pyftpsync uses file size and modification dates to detect file changes.
    This is efficient, but not as robust as CRC checksums could be.
  * pyftpsync tries to detect conflicts (i.e. simultaneous modifications of
    local and remote targets) by storing last sync time and size in a separate
    meta data file inside the local folders. This is not bullet proof and may
    fail under some conditions.
  * Currently conflicts are *not* detected, when a file is edited on one target and the parent
    folder is removed on the peer target: The folder will be removed on sync.

  In short: Make sure you have backups.
